# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel
I am currently pursuing a Computer Science Specialist program at the University of Toronto, with a focus on full stack development. I have hands-on experience working on personal projects and internships, and am comfortable with various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C, and SQL. As an ambitious and dedicated learner, I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to contribute my skills and knowledge.
