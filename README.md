#ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dani3lx
- I am currently pursuing a Computer Science Specialist program at the University of Toronto, with a focus on software development and web development. I have hands-on experience working on projects in both fields, and am comfortable with various programming languages, including Python, Java, C, and SQL. As an ambitious and dedicated learner, I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to contribute my skills and knowledge.
